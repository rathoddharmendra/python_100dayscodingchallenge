Case study for ZenJob:

Background
Zenjob is a personnel service provider for part-time jobs, automatically connecting
companies and job seekers to meet their specific needs. 

Each month, Zenjob matches
over 20,000 talents with 12,000 part-time jobs across various industries like logistics,
retail and hospitality. 

Our goal is to empower the workforce of tomorrow through
innovative technology.

As with any marketplace, ensuring supply and demand are 

**sufficient and effectively matched**

 is critical to the success of the business. 

In our job marketplace:
● Demand side: Companies requiring staff to fill shifts (short-term positions).
● Supply side: Students looking for temp jobs.

To achieve this balance, we manage a talent pool within location clusters, which group
companies based on factors like industry, job requirements, and regional proximity.
Talents can work interchangeably within these clusters.


Task and expected deliverable
One of our main challenges is  
- continuously ensuring the right level of supply ready to work (amount of high quality workers) in each cluster in order to fulfil all ordered shifts.

To address this, we plan to build a supply-demand engine in 2025 that can:
● Analyze the current and predicted status of supply and demand for each location
cluster.
● Trigger staffing decisions (e.g., reallocating talents, training new talents, or
recruiting). --> should not over do ; but optimize with some buffer

Your Task: Prepare a presentation that addresses the following:
● Identify and justify the most critical metrics to evaluate the current and predicted
status of supply and demand.
Hint: Consider the level of activity from both sides, the requirements for the jobs
and any other piece of information that may inform a well functioning
marketplace.
● Design high level how this engine would work. Include core functionalities,
decisions the engine would make, and inputs required.
● Identify potential trade-offs between different decisions the engine might make.
Discuss the impact of these trade-offs on the business.
● Use a hypothetical case to demonstrate how the engine would make decisions.
Example: “Cluster A has a demand spike. How does the engine prioritize and
act?”
Hints and Guidance:
● use examples to support your ideas
● feel free to make assumptions and hypotheses and follow through with them. It’s
not important if they represent the actual state of Zenjob.
● Use any visual support (slides, Miro, Gdoc) you feel comfortable with.
Evaluation criteria
There’s no right or wrong solution. In this case we will evaluate:
● How you set the right goals for a product and measure against them
● How you identify, frame, and evaluate trade-offs
● How you analyze and debug potential challenges
During the shareback session, you will have 20’ to guide us through your thought
process. After that we will ask clarifying questions and discuss openly about your ideas.
Next Steps

assumptions:
how Zenjob really works****


main goal: is to fill all open positions*, and predict and prepare workforce
- t: how to track or understand demand
key words:

 talent pool: no. of students registered in a proximity or cities like Berlin, 
 
 shifts: short term positions
  
location cluster: group companies based on - industry, job requirements, regional proximity


step:
- document design - per requirements
- diagraming 
- understand requirements to put in document - identintify attributes
